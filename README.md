Express + React Boilerplate

This is my own boilerplate for server-side rendering of React apps with Express.js routing, Webpack and ESLint.

#INSTALL
in your cli:
  - git clone the repository
  - npm install
  - npm run build (to create the bundle with Webpack)
  - npm run start (to start the server)

In ./src directory
  - server.js => create your routes, import your components and pass them to the proper route
  - /components => add your components
